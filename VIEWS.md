### **View Name**: `product_sales`

**Description**:
The `product_sales` view consolidates and represents sales information related to various products that have been ordered.

**Usage**:
The view is particularly useful for generating sales-related reports and analytics. As seen in the admin related procedures, it allows users to obtain sales data filtered by various parameters such as product, category, time frame, and more. The consolidation of this data into a view makes it easier to write and understand the SQL used for these analytics, as the underlying complexities of the data relationships are abstracted away.
