# Installation Guide

## Implementation Details

- This project is using a SQL database to manage data.
- This Project uses API to interact with the UI and the database.
- Front End is developed using React
- API is developed using NodeJS (Express)
- According to the project's specifications, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is not used at any point. Instead, the project exclusively utilizes standard SQL queries for all database interactions.
- Developed using NodeJS v18.17.1

## Getting started

- Required Softwares
  - MySQL Workbench 8
  - NodeJS v18.17.1 or higher (version updates are not recommended)
  - Prefered Code editor that can run JavaScript

To get started with the platform, follow these steps :

1.  Clone this repository.
    plaintext
    https://github.com/PasanMadhuranga/Ecommerce-Platform-G32

2. Utilize a MySQL client, such as the MySQL Workbench (recommended) or the MySQL command line client. Navigate to the "database" directory, and execute the `G32_Complete_Database.sql` script. This action will initialize your database, incorporating all requisite stored procedures, functions, views, triggers, and indexes. Additionally, it will populate the database with preliminary sample data.

3.  Open a new Terminal from the cloned directory and cd in to the server directory.

    ```plaintext
    cd server
    ```

    Install the dependencies using following command. (Activate the Virutal Environment if you are using one. It's recommended to use one.)

    ```plaintext
    npm i
    ```

    Start the server using following command

    ```plaintext
    npm start
    ```

4.  create .env file inside the server directory including following environmental variables.(You are supposed to update variable values according to your sql environment. You can simply copy the text below, modify it and save at the specified path as a .env file. Also you can fill the .env.example according to your data and remove the .example part).

    - JWT_SECRET and JWT_REFRESH_SECRET should be strong and uncommon for security reasons. (Recommend random strings which has about 64 characters)

    ```dotenv
    DB_PASSWORD=<MySQL Password here>
    DB_PORT=<MySQL Port here>
    JWT_SECRET=<Create a powerful JWT secret key for access token>
    JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<Create a powerful JWT secret key for refresh token>
    ```

5.  Go back to the previous directory and go to the client directory.

    ```plaintext
    cd ..\client
    ```

    Then install the dependencies using following command.

    ```plaintext
    npm i
    ```

    Start the React app using following command.

    ```plaintext
    npm start
    ```

6.  Now website will automatically open with your web browser.
